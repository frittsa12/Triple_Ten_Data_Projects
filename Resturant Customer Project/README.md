# Resturant Customer Project. 


## The purpose of this project is to analyze customer behavior and segmentation within Zomato to identify distinct customer groups, their purchasing patterns, and preferences, ultimately providing actionable insights to enhance marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.


- Define the research questions and objectives for customer analysis to clarify the focus of the project.
- Collect and clean customer data from the provided datasets to ensure accuracy for analysis.

- Create visualizations that illustrate customer segments and behaviors using charts in the dashboard in Talbeau.
- Compile findings and recommendations into a comprehensive report summarizing insights and suggested strategies for improving customer engagement.


- I built a customer segmentation dashboard for Zomato to visualize and analyze customer behaviors and preferences. This tool helps identify distinct customer groups, enabling targeted marketing strategies and improved customer engagement.
