What is Causing Returns?
Join the Returns table with the Orders table using a LEFT JOIN.
Create a calculated field where:
“Yes” = 1 (Returned orders)
“Null” = 0 (Non-returned orders)
Build at least one worksheet for each analysis:
Scatterplot: Total sales vs. total returns by product subcategory.
Bar chart: Return rate by product category.
Return rate by customer:
Add a filter to remove customers with only one order.
Map visualization: Return rate by geographic location (state, city, etc.).
Time-based analysis: Return rate by a measure of time (month, week, etc.).
Two composite charts:
Mix of multiple factors (e.g., date/geography/product category).
Document dashboard design requirements based on key findings.
2. Building a Dashboard for Monitoring Returns
Create a low-fidelity mock-up of the dashboard:
At least three variations (pen-and-paper sketches).
Submit scanned photos or images of the sketches.
Select the best mock-up for implementation.
Create a Tableau template for the dashboard:
Use empty containers matching the mock-up design.
Take a screenshot of the template for submission.
Build the final dashboard in Tableau:
Add worksheets to the template.
Finalize with titles, labels, and markers for clarity.
Submit:
Mock-ups
Template screenshot
Final dashboard
3. Presenting Your Analysis and Dashboard
Construct a story arc for the presentation:
Draft a Story in Tableau with captions only.
Include:
Summary of the returns analysis.
Explanation of how returns should be measured (return rate, cost, or count).
Identification of key root causes of returns.
Overview of each Dashboard component:
Description of each chart and its interpretation.
Demonstration of how to use the Dashboard:
Show filters for identifying root causes.
Explain how insights can drive business actions.
Conclusion & next steps (e.g., implementing the Dashboard).
Enhance the Story Points:
Add relevant worksheets and dashboards to support the narrative.
Create presentation-style dashboards in Tableau.
Save a version of the Tableau Story for submission.
Deliver a 3-5 minute presentation:
Submit in one of two formats:
Screen recording (QuickTime, Windows built-in recorder, etc.).
PDF slides with explanations.
4. Submitting Your Project
Create a ZIP archive containing:
README.md file with a link to Tableau Public.
Tableau workbook and supporting files (total size ≤ 9MB).
Mock-ups, templates, and final dashboard files.
Presentation (screen recording or PDF).
