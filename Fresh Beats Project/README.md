### Conclusion
The analysis reveals significant insights into user behavior and genre trends on the Fresh Beats platform. While the pop genre experienced a peak in 2021 and is currently declining, electronic and hip hop music are gaining popularity, indicating shifting user preferences. The data shows that paid users are more active, listening to more music and demonstrating better retention compared to free users, who favor rock music as their most popular genre. These findings highlight the importance of tailoring promotional strategies and content recommendations to capitalize on emerging trends and enhance user engagement across different user segments. By focusing on these areas, Fresh Beats can optimize its offerings and drive sustained growth in both user activity and subscription conversions.


### Recommendations
Marketing should try focused campaigns targeting typical demographics for fans of these genres.
We should analyze user retention in these genres, and consider how we can maximize it.
Product/marketing teams should try experiments to generate leads in alternative genres.
Consider intermediate tiers between free and paid, to make it easier to convert users from free to paid.
Offer users a referral marketing option, so they can get a free trial of the paid tier by referring new users.
It is worth doing deeper research into previous years to understand why pop is on a downwards trend.
Try promotions focused on rock that offer free trials to convert to paid users.
We should analyze more ways to increase the engagement of rock-listening users, as a potential growth segment.
Indie is particularly popular with paid users, so focus promotions there.
