Part 1: Build a Conversion Funnel
Create a new sheet named “conversion_funnel” using a pivot table.
Count unique users for three stages: product page views, cart openings, and purchases.
Add columns for total conversion rates and conversion rates to the next step.
Part 2: Prepare Data for Cohort Analysis
Create a new sheet called “purchase_activity.”
Filter the “raw_user_activity” sheet for purchase events and copy the filtered data to “purchase_activity” (should contain 4,845 rows).
Insert a pivot table in a new sheet called “first_purchase” to calculate the minimum event date for each user.
Add a column in “purchase_activity” for first purchase dates using VLOOKUP().
Create three new columns: event_month, first_purchase_month, and cohort_age.
Use TEXT() for event_month and first_purchase_month; use DATEDIF() for cohort_age.
Part 3: Calculate Retention Rates
Insert a pivot table in a new sheet called “cohort_analysis” to represent cohorts based on the month of first purchase.
Calculate the count of unique users for each cohort_age.
Create a new sheet named “retention_rates” to layout a table for retention rates.
Add row labels for cohorts and column labels for cohort ages (1-4 months).
Write formulas to calculate retention rates based on cohort sizes.
Part 4: Organize and Document the Spreadsheet
Fill in the “Executive Summary” with results and analysis descriptions.
Summarize findings from the “conversion_funnel” and “retention_rates” sheets.
Explain data properties, assumptions, and cohort analysis decisions.
Organize the sheet tabs: Table of Contents and Executive Summary first, followed by analytical results, calculations, and raw data.
Complete the “Table of Contents” with descriptions for each section.
Format the spreadsheet for readability, including borders, bold fonts, and frozen rows.
