# Business Project  


## Analyze user activity data from an e-commerce website to create a conversion funnel and cohort analysis that provides insights into users behavior.


- Created a pivot table for the conversion funnel, identifying unique users at each stage: product views, cart openings, and purchases.  
- Filtered purchase events from the raw data and copied 4,845 rows to the “purchase_activity” sheet for focused analysis. 
- Calculated first purchase dates using a pivot table, allowing for accurate cohort assignment based on users' initial transactions.
- Added new columns for event and first purchase months, facilitating monthly cohort analysis with proper formatting.
- Constructed a cohort analysis pivot table, representing six cohorts based on first purchase month and tracking unique user counts over cohort ages
- Developed a retention rates table, calculating retention for each cohort at ages 1-4 months, aiding in understanding user engagement over time.
- Documented findings and analyses in the Executive Summary, summarizing key insights and assumptions from the data.
- Organized the spreadsheet layout, improving readability and accessibility by reordering sheets and adding a Table of Contents.

I built a conversion funnel and a cohort analysis framework to understand user behavior and track retention rates in an e-commerce environment. This was essential 
for the company to identify how effectively they convert visitors into purchasers and to analyze the longevity of customer engagement over time.   
The project addressed the need for insights into user interactions with the website, specifically how well product views translate into purchases and how retention 
varies among different customer cohorts. This information helps the company make informed decisions on marketing strategies and website improvements.   
I utilized Google Sheets for data analysis, employing features such as pivot tables, formulas (like VLOOKUP, TEXT, and DATEDIF), and filtering tools to manipulate 
and analyze the raw user activity data.  
The project took approximately 3 weeks to complete, allowing for thorough analysis, adjustments, and documentation of findings.
I worked independently on this project.
  
### Conclusion 
The analysis of the conversion funnel revealed a purchase click-through rate (CTR) of 10% and a conversion rate (CR) of 35%, indicating a healthy 
transition from product views to actual purchases. However, the retention rate results showed a concerning downward trend each month, suggesting that while initial
conversions are strong, maintaining customer engagement over time is a challenge. The project utilized raw, unaggregated user activity data to map out the stages of
the conversion funnel and assess user retention across different time periods. These insights highlight critical areas for improvement, particularly in enhancing 
user retention strategies to foster long-term customer loyalty.



### Recommendations
Enhance User Engagement Strategies: Since the retention rates are declining each month, implementing targeted engagement strategies such as personalized marketing 
campaigns, email follow-ups, and loyalty programs could help maintain customer interest and encourage repeat purchases.
Optimize User Experience: Conduct a thorough review of the website's user interface and checkout process to identify any friction points that may deter users from 
completing purchases. Improving navigation, simplifying the checkout process, and ensuring mobile optimization can enhance overall user satisfaction.
Implement Retention Metrics Tracking: Establish a system for ongoing monitoring of retention metrics to identify trends and address issues proactively. Regular 
analysis can help pinpoint specific months or cohorts that are struggling, allowing for timely interventions.
Gather User Feedback: Actively solicit feedback from customers regarding their shopping experience. Understanding their preferences and pain points can guide 
improvements and foster a stronger connection with the brand.
