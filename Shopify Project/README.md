- Created a KPI Card to count the unique number of apps on the Shopify platform, resulting in a clear metric of app diversity.
- Generated a Line Chart to visualize the sum of review counts over time, providing insights into app engagement trends.
- Developed a Scatterplot comparing reviews count to average ratings, facilitating analysis of the relationship between user feedback and app performance.
- Calculated a new column for helpful reviews using a DAX expression, yielding an average value that reflects the weighted helpfulness of reviews.
- Constructed a scatterplot to compare average ratings against developer response status, revealing insights into developer engagement with user feedback.
- Established a new relationship between the Reviews and Apps tables, enabling comprehensive analysis of developer performance.
- Designed a bar chart to show the sum of ratings by developer, highlighting overall app performance.
- Created a bar chart to display average helpful reviews by developer, providing a clearer picture of user satisfaction.
- Compiled a bar chart to identify the most responsive developers, focusing on those with a review count greater than 500.


- I built a Power BI report consisting of multiple visualizations to analyze the landscape of Shopify apps, focusing on app performance, review dynamics, and developer responsiveness. This helped identify key factors contributing to app success and user satisfaction. 
- The project addressed the need for insights into what makes a Shopify app successful by analyzing user reviews, ratings, and developer engagement, thereby enabling better decision-making for app developers and marketers.
- I used Microsoft Power BI for data visualization and analysis, along with DAX for creating new calculated columns in the dataset.
-  The project took approximately two weeks to complete, allowing time for data analysis, visualization creation, and report refinement.
- I completed this project independently. 
  
### Conclusions
The Power BI report provides insights into a dataset of 7,341 unique apps, analyzing aspects such as review trends, rating distributions, and update frequency. The findings indicate that highly reviewed apps tend to maintain stable ratings between 4-5, suggesting strong user satisfaction. Additionally, the sum of reviews over time shows fluctuations, with notable spikes in engagement. While the report effectively presents key metrics, further analysis, such as category-based breakdowns and developer activity, could enhance understanding of app trends and market dynamics.




### Recommendations
Since apps with higher review counts tend to maintain strong ratings, developers should implement strategies to encourage user feedback, such as in-app prompts or incentives for leaving reviews.
The fluctuation in review counts over time suggests that app updates may influence user engagement. Developers should analyze update timing and content to maximize positive user interactions.
The stable high ratings indicate that consistent performance and reliability are crucial for maintaining user satisfaction. Developers should prioritize bug fixes, performance improvements, and feature enhancements.
Further breakdowns by app category could provide deeper insights into which types of apps perform best and where improvements are needed. This would help developers tailor strategies to specific market segments.
Understanding how top-rated and frequently reviewed apps maintain engagement can help newer apps adopt best practices for growth and visibility.
By implementing these recommendations, developers and stakeholders can optimize their app strategies, improve user satisfaction, and enhance overall market performance.
