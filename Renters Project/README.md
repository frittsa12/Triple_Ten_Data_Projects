- Cleaned neighborhood column labels to ensure consistent formatting, creating a new column called neighborhood_clean for better data integrity.
- Built a pivot table to identify the top 10 neighborhoods for vacation rentals based on number_of_reviews_ltm, revealing the most attractive options for investment.
- Created a bar chart visualizing the number of reviews for the top 10 neighborhoods, enhancing the analysis presentation.
- Cleaned the bedrooms column to handle empty cells, storing results in a new column called bedrooms_clean, which facilitated accurate property size analysis.
- Developed another pivot table to determine the most popular property sizes, identifying studios, 1-bedroom, and 2-bedroom listings as the top choices.
- Updated the pivot table to recommend specific property sizes for each of the top 10 neighborhoods, indicating Harlem's preference for 1-bedroom listings.
- Added a new column in the listings data called top_listing to mark listings that matched the criteria of being in top neighborhoods and the most popular property size.
- Calculated daily revenue by creating a revenue_earned column in the calendar data, indicating revenue generated for each rental night based on availability.
- Aggregated total revenue in the listings data using the SUMIF() function to quantify earnings for top listings based on 30-day rental data.
- Constructed a pivot table to rank top listings by revenue

- I built a comprehensive analysis of the Manhattan vacation rental market using Airbnb data to identify the most attractive neighborhoods and property sizes for investment, along with estimated revenue potential for top listings. This analysis is intended to guide the client in making informed investment decisions.
- The project addressed the challenge of determining optimal investment opportunities in the Manhattan vacation rental market by identifying high-demand neighborhoods and property types, as well as estimating the revenue generated by the most appealing listings.
 - I used Google Sheets for data analysis, including pivot tables, charts, and formulas to clean and manipulate the data effectively.
- The project took approximately 3 weeks to complete, allowing time for data cleaning, analysis, and reporting.
- I worked independently on this project.   
  
### Conclusions
 the analysis of the Manhattan vacation rental market highlights key opportunities for investment. The most attractive neighborhoods—Lower East Side, Hells Kitchen, and Harlem—present promising prospects for vacation rentals, particularly with 1-bedroom listings being the preferred choice across most areas, except for Midtown, where studios dominate. Additionally, the findings indicate that the top listings within these neighborhoods generate substantial revenue, averaging $203,759 annually. These insights provide a clear direction for potential investors, emphasizing the importance of focusing on the identified neighborhoods and property sizes to optimize returns in the competitive vacation rental market.





### Recommendations
Focus on 1-Bedroom Listings: Investors should prioritize acquiring 1-bedroom properties in neighborhoods like Lower East Side, Hells Kitchen, and Harlem, as these are the most attractive options for vacation rentals.
Consider Studio Apartments in Midtown: Since studios are the preferred choice in Midtown, targeting this property size in that neighborhood could yield significant returns.
Target High-Performing Neighborhoods: Invest in properties located in the top-performing neighborhoods identified in the analysis to maximize occupancy rates and revenue potential.
Enhance Marketing Strategies: Develop tailored marketing campaigns that highlight the unique features and attractions of the identified neighborhoods to attract more guests.
Monitor Market Trends: Continuously analyze market trends and guest preferences to adapt investment strategies, ensuring they remain aligned with evolving demand in the vacation rental market.
Evaluate Property Management Options: Consider partnering with property management services to enhance guest experiences and maintain high occupancy rates, which can further increase revenue.
