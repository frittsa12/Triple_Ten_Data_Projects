Data Cleaning:
Clean the neighborhood column labels for consistent capitalization and remove trailing spaces. Store cleaned values in a new column called neighborhood_clean.
Clean the bedrooms column by handling empty cells (representing studio apartments). Store cleaned values in a new column called bedrooms_clean.
Neighborhood Analysis:
Build a pivot table to identify the top 10 neighborhoods for vacation rentals based on the number_of_reviews_ltm column.
Add a bar chart to visually display the number of reviews for the top 10 neighborhoods.
Property Size Analysis:
Build a pivot table to determine the most popular property sizes (number of bedrooms) for vacation rentals.
Update the pivot table to analyze property size preferences across different neighborhoods, specifically for the top 10 neighborhoods.
Revenue Calculation:
Add a new column in the listings data called top_listing to indicate whether a listing matches the criteria of being in a top neighborhood and the most popular property size.
Create a new column in the calendar data called revenue_earned, reflecting the revenue earned each night based on rental status.
Create a corresponding revenue_earned column in the listings data using the SUMIF() function to aggregate total revenue from the calendar data.
Build a pivot table to rank top listings according to revenue, applying a filter for top_listing.
Top-Earning Listing Identification:
Identify and document the top-earning listing's ID and its revenue over a 30-day period.
Calculate the estimated annual revenue for top listings by multiplying the 30-day earnings by 12.
Documentation and Formatting:
Create an executive summary and a table of contents in the analysis.
Document all data cleaning steps in a change log.
Clearly outline any assumptions made during the analysis.
Ensure consistent formatting, including borders, colors, font styles, and sizes across the spreadsheet.
Sharing:
Prepare the spreadsheet for sharing by setting permissions to allow the reviewer to comment and ensuring the link is accessible to anyone with it.
