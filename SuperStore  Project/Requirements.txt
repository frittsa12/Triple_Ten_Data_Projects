-Conducted as student 
-Mock project 

Part 1: Profits & Losses
Identify the two biggest profit centers and two biggest loss-makers among dimension pairs (e.g., subcategory + region, shipping mode + product ID).
Provide a visualization to justify conclusions.
Identify products that the superstore should stop selling, using a visualization.
Identify three product subcategories to focus on and three to stop selling based on profitability, supported by visualizations.
Part 2: Advertising
Identify the three best state + month combinations for advertising.
Create a visualization of the average profit per month for these three states.
Determine how much to spend on advertising, using a return on ad spend ratio of 1/5 of profits.
Part 3: Returned Items
LEFT JOIN the Returns table onto the Orders table. Ensure the Returned column contains both "Yes" and "null" values.
Convert the Returned field into a calculated field where:
"Yes" = 1
"null" = 0
Create visualizations to show:
Products with the highest return rate.
Customers with the highest return rate.
Create a separate visualization of average profit vs. average return rate on a chosen dimension (e.g., state, shipping mode, product type).
Present a visual argument on whether the superstore should continue or discontinue business based on this dimension.
Part 4: Submitting the Project
Submit a ZIP archive containing:
README.md file with a link to the Tableau Public workbook.
All project files (ensure total size does not exceed 9MB).
