# SuperStore Project  


## The purpose of this project is to analyze the superstore’s profitability, optimize product offerings, assess the effectiveness of advertising strategies, and evaluate return rates to improve business decisions using data-driven visualizations in Tableau. 
Tableau [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/alison.fritts/viz/Sprint4AlisonFritts/ProductReturnReate)

- Identified key profit and loss centers by analyzing sales data to determine the two biggest profit and loss makers.
- Visualized product performance by creating profit-based comparisons to recommend products for discontinuation.
- Evaluated product subcategories by analyzing sales trends to identify three to focus on and three to stop selling.
- Determined high-return advertising opportunities by assessing state-wise and month-wise profit data to select the three best state-month combinations for ads.
- Calculated advertising budget using the return on ad spend ratio to determine the feasible cost allocation (1/5 of profits).
- Joined Returns table with Orders data using a LEFT JOIN to track returned vs. non-returned products.
- Created a calculated field to classify return statuses by converting null values to 0 and “Yes” values to 1.
- Analyzed return rates by visualizing product and customer return data to identify high-return products and customers.
- Compared profitability and return rates by plotting average profit vs. return rate to determine whether certain business dimensions should be continued or discontinued.
- Published the final Tableau dashboard on Tableau Public to share insights and allow further review.


- I built a Tableau dashboard to analyze the profitability, advertising effectiveness, and return rates of a superstore’s products. The purpose was to identify profit centers, reduce losses, optimize advertising spending, and manage product returns effectively to improve overall business performance. 
- The project solved key business challenges, including:Identifying profit and loss drivers to make data-driven decisions on which products to continue or discontinue.
Optimizing advertising strategies by pinpointing the best states and months for marketing investments.
Managing product returns by detecting high-return products and customers, allowing for better inventory and customer service management.
- Tableau was used for data visualization and dashboard creation, SQL for data manipulation (LEFT JOIN to merge Returns and Orders tables), and excel/CSV files for data preparation.
- The project took approximately 2 weeks to complete, including data gathering, analysis, visualization, and final reporting.
- I worked independently on this project. 
  
### Conclusions
The findings indicate significant profit losses across various products, particularly in printers, office furniture, and conferencing equipment, with the GBC DocuBind P400 Electric Binding System experiencing the highest loss at $20,388. Additionally, while most states show minimal profit margins, Maryland stands out with a significantly higher average profit of $1,271 in February, suggesting potential opportunities for targeted marketing efforts. The data highlights the need for strategic pricing adjustments, cost optimizations, and a reevaluation of product performance to mitigate losses. Focusing on high-performing regions and eliminating consistently underperforming products will be crucial in improving overall profitability.


### Recommendations
Products with the highest losses, such as the GBC DocuBind P400 Electric Binding System and Cubify 3D Printers, should either be discontinued, re-priced, or sourced from more cost-effective suppliers to minimize financial impact.
A thorough review of pricing models is necessary, especially for office furniture and electronic devices that show consistent losses. Consider dynamic pricing strategies to better align with demand and profitability.
Maryland showed a significantly higher average profit ($1,271 in February) compared to other states. Focus on expanding advertising, promotions, and sales efforts in such high-performing states to maximize revenue.
Conduct a cost-benefit analysis on products with minimal profits and explore ways to reduce manufacturing, shipping, or operational costs.
Since some categories (e.g., conferencing equipment, office tables) show repeated losses, consider diversifying the product lineup by introducing higher-margin alternatives or reducing reliance on low-performing categories.
Shift marketing efforts toward high-performing products and profitable regions, while reducing investments in underperforming categories. Data-driven promotions and customer segmentation can help increase conversions and sales efficiency.
Analyze demand trends to avoid overstocking underperforming products. Implement a just-in-time (JIT) inventory system to reduce excess stock and improve cash flow.
By implementing these strategic changes, the company can work towards minimizing losses, maximizing profits, and optimizing overall business performance.
